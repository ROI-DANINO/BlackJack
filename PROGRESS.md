# Progress

> What is done / in progress *now*, and open questions.

## Done
- Product vision, roadmap draft, V1 simulation draft, learning notes, and research brief were folded into tracked owned docs.
- Original pre-init notes are tracked and indexed under `docs/imports/initial-product-notes/`.
- V1 ruleset locked: 6-deck H17 DAS no-surrender peek, 3:2 blackjack, 75% default penetration.
- Rust free-play simulator core built via subagent-driven TDD (Tasks 1–6): rules, deterministic shoe, scoring, session/split engine, JSON boundary + CLI.
- Final whole-branch review remediated: dealer no longer draws after all hands are terminal (bust/natural); shoe-reshuffle recovery command preserving bankroll/logs; custom-ruleset validation at session creation; `RoundLog` carries the full ruleset so any hand is reproducible from its log alone. 45 tests green (fmt + clippy clean).
- `blackjack` extracted from the Projects spine into its own standalone git repo (history preserved); spine now gitignores it.

## In progress
- V1 Simulation Foundations: Rust simulator core complete; next is the TypeScript UI bridge over the JSON/WASM-ready boundary.

## Open questions
- How should the BlackjackInfo chart be encoded into the first machine-readable Basic Strategy table?
- What exact card lifecycle model will support future CSM/ASM variants cleanly?
